# Rockbox Utilities
## Utilities for managing a Rockbox library on iPods (or similar devices running Rockbox)

### coverResize.py (Linux-only)
- Automatically resize all large cover art (cover.jpg/cover.png) in your iPod library to 500x500, more than enough for the iPod's screen, while ensuring small file sizes and quick loading times for album art.

### flac2mp3.py (Linux-only)
- Automatically covert all available FLAC files on your device to high-quality 320kbps MP3, using ffmpeg. May expand this into a larger utility that supports more formats.
